Enhance clojure records to:
 * print in an eval'able form
 * provide clojure function as constructor
 * accept named parameters (maps) in constructor
 * participate in pre/post walk multi-method

modified defrecord2 macro so i could include protocols
got rid of print-method and pprint method
fixed support for print-dup so it outputs #= and also namespace of constructor
